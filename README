Sensory 626 MATLAB Interface
Version 1.0



DIRECTORY STRUCTURE ------------------------------------------------------------

  driver/     original Sensory driver source code 
  inc/        header files for the sensoray drivers and mex interface 
  lib/        location of compiled libraries
  matlab/     some demo matlab function showing how to use the interface 
  mex/        location of compiled mex files 
  src/        c/c++ source files for the s626 mex interface



INSTALL ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  You must first install the Sensory 626 drivers. This can be done using the
  provided Makefile.

    cd driver sudo make install
 
  Make sure the driver is loaded.

    sudo modprobe s626

  To verify that it is loaded you can run:

    lsmod | grep s626
    
  The output should be something similar to:
    
    s626            11988   2



COMPILE THE INTERFACE ---------------------------------------------------------

  There is also a Makefile provided to compile the mex interface to the 
  drivers. This compiles the static library for the Sensory interfaces and the
  s626 mex file. 

    make all

  libs626.a will be created in ./lib
  s626.mexglx and time.mexglx will be created in ./mex



USING THE INTERFACE ------------------------------------------------------------

Please see matlab/s626_example.m for examples of how to use all of the available
functions. 


The IIR filter used by the velocity and acceleration estimates is as follows:
v_new = (weight * v_current) + ((1 - weight) * v_previous);


The ecoder mapping is as follows:
index     name
1         CNTR_0A
2         CNTR_1A
3         CNTR_2A
4         CNTR_0B
5         CNTR_1B
6         CNTR_2B


matlab/encoder_plot.m is a matlab struct that will plot the 
matlab/plot_encoder.m is a script that uses an instance of encoder_plot to plot
the encoder values in real time. In matlab run:
>> plot_encoder

each encoder is plotted in a different color
1         red
2         green
3         blue
4         black
5         yellow
6         magenta
